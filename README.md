# Description

This sample is part of the [Learn Forge](http://learnforge.autodesk.io) tutorials.

# Setup

For using this sample, you need an Autodesk developer credentials. Visit the [Forge Developer Portal](https://developer.autodesk.com), sign up for an account, then [create an app](https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps/create). For this new app, use **http://localhost:3000/api/forge/callback/oauth** as Callback URL, although is not used on 2-legged flow. Finally take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

Now we need an IDE to write the code. There are many options, this sample will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

> For this sample, use all default install options.

Next, install the extension of **PHP Server** & **PHP Debug** for Visual Code, this can help debug your PHP project.

- Go to Visual Code extension manager (left side, bottom icon)
- Type `PHP` and install `PHP Server` & `PHP Debug` plugins.

### Run locally

Install [PHP](http://php.net/downloads.php).

Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).


Clone this project or download it. It's recommended to install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (**Terminal** on MacOSX/Linux, **Git Shell** on Windows):

    git clone https://github.com/autodesk-forge/forge.learning.viewmodels.php

To run it, follow the steps:

1. install the required packages:

```
composer install
```

2. rename **.env.example** to **.env**, and set the FORGE_CLIENT_ID & FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET with your Forge client ID & secret;
3. open the Command Palette from VS Code, and run the command **Serve Project With PHP**, it will start PHP server at port 3000.
4. open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`


## Deploy to Heroku
Define config vars from your Forge App Key with the following command in Heroku:
* heroku config:set FORGE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL"
* heroku config:set FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR CLIENT SECRET FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL"

 Open the live demo at [https://forgeviewerphp.herokuapp.com](https://forgeviewerphp.herokuapp.com)

## Packages used

- The [Autodesk Forge](https://packagist.org/packages/autodesk/forge-client) packages is included by default.
- The [klein](https://packagist.org/packages/klein/klein) is used for router.
- The [phpdotenv](https://packagist.org/packages/vlucas/phpdotenv) is used to load environment variables from `.env` to `getenv()`, `$_ENV` and `$_SERVER` automagically.



# Tips & tricks

We rewrite the url to have a clean url. to config that:
For Apache, .htaccess is added to do url rewrite.

If you want to work with Nginx, open nginx.conf, find the server, add the following code in server{ location/{ } }
<pre><code>
    if (!-e $request_filename) {
        rewrite  ^(.*)$  /index.php?s=$1  last;
        break;
    }
</code></pre>

## Troubleshooting
Note: If Composer command can not be recognized after installation, please move and rename composer.phar to folder /usr/local/bin/ with the following command:

>$ mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

Check the detail at [Answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25018894/osx-bash-composer-command-not-found).

If you run into initialization errors after upgrading your [phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) to V3, change the loader construction in `./server/config.php` accordingly:


```
$dotenv = Dotenv::create(__DIR__); // change line 13 to this from `$dotenv = new Dotenv(__DIR__);`
```
