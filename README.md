# Description

This sample is part of the [Learn Forge](http://learnforge.autodesk.io) tutorials.

# Setup

To use this sample, you will need Autodesk developer credentials. Visit the [Forge Developer Portal](https://developer.autodesk.com), sign up for an account, then [create an app](https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps/create). For this new app, use **http://localhost:3000/api/forge/callback/oauth** as the Callback URL, although it is not used on a 2-legged flow. Finally, take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### Run locally

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

Clone this project or download it. It's recommended to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (**Terminal** on MacOSX/Linux, **Git Shell** on Windows):

    git clone https://github.com/autodesk-forge/forge.learning.viewmodels.nodejs

To run it, install the required packages, set the enviroment variables with your client ID & Secret and finally start it. Via command line, navigate to the folder where this repository was cloned to and use the following commands:

Mac OSX/Linux (Terminal)

    npm install
    export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>
    npm start

Windows (use **Node.js command line** from the Start menu)

    npm install
    set FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    set FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>
    npm start

Open the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Packages used

The [Autodesk Forge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forge-apis) packages are included by default. Some other non-Autodesk packages are used, including [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) for upload.

# Tips & tricks

For local development/ testing, consider using the [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) package, which auto-restarts your node application after any modification to your code. To install it, use:

    sudo npm install -g nodemon

Then, instead of **npm run dev**, use the following:

    npm run nodemon

Which executes **nodemon server.js --ignore www/**, where the **--ignore** parameter indicates that the app should not restart if files under the **www** folder are modified.

## Troubleshooting

After installing GitHub Desktop for Windows, on the Git Shell, if you see the ***error setting certificate verify locations*** error, then use the following command:

    git config --global http.sslverify "false"
